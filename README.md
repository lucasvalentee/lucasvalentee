## Hello, my name is Lucas Valente, and I'm 24 years old, originally from Santa Catarina, Brazil.

My journey in programming began in 2018 when I started my Bachelor's degree in Information Systems at UNIDAVI. Early on, I took my first steps in a PHP application following the MVC model. However, as my journey progressed, my interest gravitated strongly toward the JavaScript language. In 2020, I made the decision to redirect my career, focusing my efforts on the realms of Node.js and Angular. During this transition, I played a significant role in the development of a robust ERP system.

Currently, I hold the position of a software engineer in an exciting and challenging environment. My work revolves around the development of chatbots for hotels. Additionally, I am actively involved in building a comprehensive administrative system, utilizing various technologies such as Node.js, Angular, ReactJS, Java, and AWS. Moreover, I go beyond the scope of chatbots, participating in the planning of new system features and continually seeking improvements.

In addition to the previously mentioned technologies, I have experience with Next.js, Prisma, and other relevant libraries in the context of the React ecosystem.

I am highly communicative and enjoy sharing knowledge with my colleagues and friends. I am always open to new challenges and opportunities in the field of programming, eager to continue my journey of growth and innovation.
